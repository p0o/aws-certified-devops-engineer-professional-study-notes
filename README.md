# AWS Certified DevOps Engineer - Professional Study Notes

This repository provides a collection of notes, tips, and resources that I found helpful while preparing for the AWS Certified DevOps Engineer - Professional exam. Iâ€™m sharing them to support other professionals pursuing this certification. However, please note that this is not a comprehensive guide, and it may not cover everything you need to pass the exam.
